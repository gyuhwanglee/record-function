The provided code is a JavaScript function that facilitates copying text to the clipboard in a web application using the React framework. It also displays a toast notification using the 'react-toastify' library to inform the user that the text has been successfully copied.

# Here's a breakdown of the code:

## Importing the necessary modules:

The 'react-toastify' module is imported to display the toast notification.
Defining the notify function:

This function is responsible for displaying the toast notification.
It uses the toast.success method from the 'react-toastify' library to show a success message with the text "Copied".
The {} empty object is passed as the second argument to the toast.success method.
Exporting the ClickCopy function:

This function accepts a parameter called text, which represents the text to be copied to the clipboard.

- It logs the value of text to the console using console.log.
- It checks if the navigator.clipboard API is available (supported by modern browsers).
- If the API is available, it uses the writeText method to write the text to the clipboard.
- If the text is successfully copied, it calls the notify function to display the toast notification.
- If an error occurs during the copy process, it displays a simple alert to the user with the message "Please try copying again."

The provided code demonstrates a simple and reusable function that allows copying text to the clipboard in a web application using React. It also provides visual feedback to the user through a toast notification, indicating whether the copy operation was successful or not.
