Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code imports the `coupang_data` object from a file named `dummy_data`.
2. It assigns various elements on the webpage to variables using `getElementById` method.
3. The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener is added, which executes the `fieldDateHandle` and `createProductSelect` functions when the HTML document is fully loaded.
4. The `fieldDateHandle` function iterates over the `coupang_data` array and sets the values of different elements based on the `title` property of each item.
5. Inside the loop, it checks the `title` property and assigns the corresponding value to the appropriate element using `innerHTML`.
6. There is a condition where an `img` element is created and appended to an element with the id "coupang_main_img".
7. The `createProductSelect` function also iterates over the `coupang_data` array and sets the values of elements based on the `title` property.
8. It dynamically creates HTML elements (`tr`, `td`, `div`, `p`, `span`) and sets their attributes and inner HTML to create a product selection box.
9. The created elements are appended to the relevant parent elements in the DOM.

The code also includes two comments at the end, providing instructions for two tasks:

1. Adding `<br>` tags based on certain conditions.
2. Writing a function to create and populate tag values in the selection box.

To provide an explanation in the README, you can describe the purpose of the code, how it retrieves data from `dummy_data`, and how it manipulates the DOM to display the retrieved data on the webpage. You can also mention the tasks specified in the comments and explain how they can be implemented.
